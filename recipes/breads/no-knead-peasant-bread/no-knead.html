                    No-Knead Peasant Bread
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aah... I see you have stumbled upon my favourite bread recipe in all seven corners of the world... Very well done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This no-knead peasant bread is one of the simplest bread recipes you will ever have the pleasure of baking, but just because the recipe is simple, does not mean the bread is too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with many other breads, this one is very versatile. You can change the flour, mix and match different flours, <strong>add</strong> ingredients to the dough; such as cheese, nuts, seeds and even beer! Yes, I said beer. 
                </p>
                <p>But without further ado, lets get baking.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>4 Cups (512g)</strong> All-Purpose Flour or White Bread Flour</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Teaspoons (10g)</strong> kosher salt</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Cups (454g)</strong> lukewarm water (made by mixing <strong>1.5 Cups</strong> cold water & <strong>0.5 Cups</strong> boiling water)</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Teaspoons (8g)</strong> sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Teaspoons</strong> instant yeast</li>
                    <li>Room temperature <strong>Butter</strong>, about 2 tablespoons</li>
                </ul>
            <hr>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mixing the dough:</strong></li>
                        <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Add the water. Mix until the flour is absorbed, and you are left with a sticky dough.</p>
                    <li><strong>Let it rise:</strong></li>
                        <p>Cover bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour.</p>
                    <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 218&deg;C (425&deg;F):</strong></li>
                        <p>Grease a 3 - 4L oven-safe bowl with about a tablespoon of butter. </p>
                        <p>Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to turn the dough up onto itself, meaning, work with your one fork at a "12 o'clock" position, and the other at a "6 o'clock" position and pull them towards each other and meet at the center of the bowl. Keep on doing this... 1 & 7, 2 & 8, 3 & 9, etc.</p>
                        <p>You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, and you want to make sure you’ve punched it down. Scoop up your dough and place it into your prepared bowls.</p>
                    <li><strong>Let the dough rise again:</strong></li>
                        <p>Let the dough rise for about 20 to 30 minutes <em>uncovered</em> on the countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just below or above the top of the bowls.</p>
                    <li><strong>Bake it:</strong></li>
                        <p>Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 190&deg;C (375&deg;F) and bake for 15 to 17 minutes longer.</p>
                        <p>Remove from the oven and turn the loaves onto cooling racks. If you’ve greased the bowls well, the loaves should fall right out onto the cooling racks.</p>
                        <p>If the loaves look a little pale and soft when you’ve turned them out onto your cooling racks, place the loaves into the oven (outside of their bowls) and let them bake for about 5 minutes longer.</p>
                        <p>Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
                </ol>
