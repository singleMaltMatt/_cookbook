    <!--find a cute cat icon to use as 'background-image' to 'repeat-y' on the right side of the page-->
    <!--use 'background-size: contain' for displaying photos of the food. and perhaps add borders-->
    <!--figure out the viewport thing-->
    <!--make an alt picture if you do not have a photo of the food to use in a specific recipe (like "alt="placeholderimage.png" if possible-->
    <!--when creating the form. and using the "action" attribute. direct new forms to maybe recipe index. of a seperate folder called "new recipes" or something. you need to find out how that will save. will you actually need to host a small server for all the new recipes? or will you be able to create a "recipe" folder in the user's gdrive, which would probably be better, because it will feel more personal etc. (it would be nice to be able to publish their recipes to the app so that others can also use them) for that you will need to probably host a small server. maybe find out if the app can permanently stay connected to a gdrive folder. OR! the gdrive of the business email. (neriumfoundries@gmail.com.. hehehe. find out about security risks though.-->
